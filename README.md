# 🎨🧑‍💻 SynapGrid – Pixel UI Tool

🚀 A futuristic AI-powered pixel-based UI creation tool that merges neural interaction design, programmable creativity, and full-stack engineering — crafted entirely by a passionate AI & Software Engineering student.

> ⚠️ *This project is currently under development. SynapGrid is more than a pixel art tool — it's a neural-inspired UI builder with a creative mind of its own.*

## 🌟 What is SynapGrid?

**SynapGrid** is a pixel-based digital interface tool that allows users to build creative visuals and user interface elements using a smart grid engine — enhanced with AI modules (coming soon) for smart suggestions, completions, and design predictions.

It’s not just drawing — it’s **thinking in pixels**.
